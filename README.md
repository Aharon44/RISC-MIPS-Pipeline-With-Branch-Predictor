# RISC-MIPS-Pipeline-With-Branch-Predictor

The goal of this project was to design and implement a pipeline RISC CPU with a branch predictor unit.
Two versions of Branch Predictior were design, one is simple version of a State Machine and one version of a machine learning called a perceptron.
The two versions of Branch Predictors were implament, simulate and  synthesise to evaluate and compare the solutions in
terms of performance (running speed, percentage of accuracy) and area.

A summary of the results can be found in the presentation

â€¢ The algorithms of the perceptron and its results were taken from the following article:
